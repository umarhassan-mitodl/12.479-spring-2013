description: The Periodic Table of the elements is essential for understanding the
  geochemical behavior of trace elements. Elements in yellow squares are major elements
  because their abundances in igneous rocks are typically greater than 0.1 wt.%. Note
  that the majority of elements (pink squares) have abundance less than 0.1 wt.%;
  they are trace elements. Background photo (from USGS) is a basaltic eruption at
  Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii. Image by MIT OpenCourseWare.
